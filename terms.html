    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 1, 2026</p>

    <p>By downloading or using the "Proof - OCD & Anxiety Relief" app (the "App"), you agree to these terms. If you do not agree, you must uninstall the App immediately.</p>

    <h2>1. Not a Medical Device</h2>
    <div class="warning">
        <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> This App is a productivity and utility tool designed to provide visual verification of tasks. It is <strong>NOT</strong> a medical device and is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any mental health condition, including Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) or clinical anxiety.
    </div>
    <p>The content and tools provided by this App are not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always seek the advice of your physician or other qualified health provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition.</p>

    <h2>2. Not a Guarantee of Security</h2>
    <p>The App allows you to create a visual record (a photo) of a specific state (e.g., a locked door) at a specific time. However, the App cannot guarantee the safety or security of your property.</p>
    <p><strong>We are not liable for any loss, theft, damage, or injury</strong> that occurs to you or your property, regardless of whether you used the App to "verify" the status of that property. You acknowledge that a photo is merely a record of a moment in time and does not prevent future events.</p>

    <h2>3. User-Generated Content & Privacy</h2>
    <p>Photos you take with the App are stored locally on your device or your personal cloud storage (e.g., iCloud, Google Photos). We do not host, view, or have access to your photos. You are solely responsible for the content you create and share using the App.</p>

    <h2>4. In-App Purchases & Refunds</h2>
    <p>The App may offer paid features ("Pro" access). These transactions are processed directly by the Apple App Store or Google Play Store.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Refunds:</strong> We do not have the ability to process refunds. You must contact Apple or Google support directly for any billing disputes.</li>
        <li><strong>Lifetime Access:</strong> "Lifetime" refers to the lifetime of the App's availability on the store. We reserve the right to discontinue the App at any time, though we will make reasonable efforts to provide notice.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, the App developers shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of data, emotional distress, or property damage resulting from your use of the App.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to modify these terms at any time. Continued use of the App signifies your acceptance of the updated terms.</p>

    <h2>7. Contact</h2>
    <p>For support or questions, please contact us at: <a href="mailto:janak.sawale0@gmail.com">janak.sawale0@gmail.com</a></p>
